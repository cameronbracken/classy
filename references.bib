abstract = {Water managers throughout the Western U.S. depend on seasonal forecasts to assist with operations and planning. In this study, we develop a seasonal forecasting model to aid water resources decision-making in the Truckee-Carson River System. We analyze large-scale climate information that has a direct impact on our basin of interest to develop predictors to spring runoff. The predictors are snow water equivalent (SWE) and 500mb geopotential height and sea surface temperature (SST) ``indices'' developed in this study. We use local regression methods to provide ensemble (probabilistic) forecasts. Results show that the incorporation of climate information, particularly the 500mb geopotential height index, improves the skills of forecasts at longer lead times when compared with forecasts based on snowpack information alone. The technique is general and could be used to incorporate large- scale climate information into ensemble streamflow forecasts for other river basins.},

title = {A semiparametric multivariate and multisite weather generator},
abstract = {We propose a semiparametric multivariate weather generator with greater ability to reproduce the historical statistics, especially the wet and dry spells. The proposed approach has two steps: (1) a Markov Chain for generating the precipitation state (i.e., no rain, rain, or heavy rain), and (2) a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) bootstrap resampler for generating the multivariate weather variables. The Markov Chain captures the spell statistics while the k-NN bootstrap captures the distributional and lag-dependence statistics of the weather variables. Traditional k-NN generators tend to under-simulate the wet and dry spells that are keys to watershed and agricultural modeling for water planning and management; hence the motivation for this research. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach and its improvement over the traditional k-NN approach through an application to daily weather data from Pergamino in the Pampas region of Argentina. We show the applicability of the proposed framework in simulating weather scenarios conditional on the seasonal climate forecast and also at multiple sites in the Pampas region.},

abstract = {A multivariate, nonparametric time series simulation method is provided to generate random sequences of daily weather variables that ``honor'' the statistical properties of the historical data of the same weather variables at the site. A vector of weather variables (solar radiation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average dew point temperature, average wind speed, and precipitation) on a day of interest is resampled from the historical data by conditioning on the vector of the same variables (feature vector) on the preceding day. The resampling is done from the k nearest neighbors in state space of the feature vector using a weight function. This approach is equivalent to a nonparametric approximation of a multivariate, lag 1 Markov process. It does not require prior assumptions as to the form of the joint probability density function of the variables. An application of the resampling scheme with 30 years of daily weather data at Salt Lake City, Utah, is provided. Results are compared with those from the application of a multivariate autoregressive model similar to that of Richardson [1981].},

title = {A nonparametric approach for paleohydrologic reconstruction of annual streamflow ensembles},
abstract = {As multicentury records of natural hydrologic variability, tree ring reconstructions of streamflow have proven valuable in water resources planning and management. All previous reconstructions have used parametric methods, most often regression, to develop a model relating a set of tree ring data to a target hydrology. In this paper, we present the first development and application of a K nearest neighbor (KNN) nonparametric method to reconstruct naturalized annual streamflow ensembles from tree ring chronology data in the Upper Colorado River Basin region. The method is developed using tree ring chronologies from the period 1400--2005 and naturalized streamflow from the period 1906--2005 at the important Lees Ferry, Arizona, gauge on the Colorado River to develop annual streamflow ensembles for this gauge for the 1400-- 1905 period. The proposed KNN algorithm was developed and tested using cross validation for the overlap period, i.e., the contemporary observed period for which both the tree ring and streamflow data are available (1906--2005). The cross-validated streamflow reconstructions for the selected contemporary period compare very well with the observed flows and also with published parametric streamflow reconstructions for this gauge. The proposed nonparametric method provides an ensemble of streamflows for each year in the paleohydrologic reconstruction period (1400--1905) and, consequently, a more realistic asymmetric confidence interval than one obtained through most parametric approaches. Also, the K nearest neighbors are obtained only from the tree ring chronology data, and thus, the method can be used to reconstruct structured and even nonnumerical data for use in water resources modeling.},

abstract = {Climatic fluctuations have profound effects on water resources variability in the western United States. The effects are manifested in several ways and scales particularly in the occurrence, frequency, and magnitude of extreme events. The research reported herein centers on streamflow predictability at the medium and long range scales in the headwaters of six rivers that originate in the State of Colorado. Specifically, we want to improve the capability of forecasting seasonal and yearly flows. The analysis will focus on forecasting seasonal (April-July) and yearly (April- March) and (October-September) streamflows based on atmospheric-oceanic forcing factors, such as geopotential height, wind, and sea surface temperature (SST), as well as hydrologic factors such as snow water equivalent (SWE). The approach followed in the study includes: search for potential predictors, apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and multiple linear regression (MLR) for forecasting at individual sites, apply Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) for forecasting at multiple sites, and test the forecasting models. The forecast models have been tested in two modes: (a) fitting and (b) evaluation. In addition, some measures of forecast skill have been utilized. The study includes comparisons of forecasts using all possible predictors, i.e. hydrologic, atmospheric, and oceanic variables, using atmospheric and oceanic variables only, and using oceanic predictors only. In addition, we compared forecasts at the six sites by using aggregation and disaggregation procedures. The study brought into relevance the significant benefits of using atmospheric and oceanic predictors, in addition to hydrological predictors, for long range streamflow forecasting. It has been shown that forecasts based on PCA applied to individual sites give very good results based on various forecast performance measures for both seasonal as well as yearly time scales. Also it has been shown that even though the PCA has been applied on a site by site basis yet the forecasts approximate well the historical cross-correlation although some underestimation was noted for two sites. We also found that forecasts made using CCA are less efficient than those based on PCA even regarding the cross-correlations among sites. Furthermore, the forecast procedures based on aggregation and disaggregation (in the case of multiple sites) produced only modest results.},

title = {RiverWare decision support tool for planning sustainable river development with hydropower},
abstract = {Fresh water supplies, energy and environmental preservation are three of the most pressing issues facing humanity. Planning for development of reservoir and hydropower on the rivers of the world can be improved by the use of powerful tools to analyze the natural hydrologic supply of water and determine the most effective management that balances human and ecosystem needs. Simulation and optimization modeling tools must be flexible to analyze structural and mult-objective operational alternatives under the varying and changing hydrology. Hydropower operations should additionally consider potential variations and trends in the value of energy. Environmental effects including water quality and riparian habitats are also operating objectives. Results of planning studies include risk-based predictions of the benefits and effects of a proposed project. Trade-off and sensitivity analysis provide additional input to the decision-making process. The University of Colorado Center for Advanced Decision Support for Water and Environmental Systems develops tools for planning studies with these capabilities. The RiverWare suite of tools includes: 1) generation of synthetic hydrologic sequences that capture natural variability and trends due to climate change; 2) long-lead forecasting capabilities based on climate signals; 3) mulit-objective river and reservoir modeling tools including hydropower with value of energy; and 4) statistical analysis tools for representation of the outcomes of the analysis. These tools are used by major water management agencies in the US such as Bureau of Reclamation, Corps of Engineers and Tennessee Valley Authority, and also numerous smaller water management agencies. This paper and presentation describe these tools and two application by AMEC Earth and Environmental for the El Dorado Irrigation District in California, and the Tarrent County Regional Water District in Ft. Worth, Texas.},

title = {A stochastic nonparametric approach for streamflow generation combining observational and paleoreconstructed data},
abstract = {The Colorado River basin experienced the worst drought on record during 2000-- 2004. Paleoreconstructions of streamflow for the preobservational period show droughts of greater magnitude and duration, indicating that the recent drought is not unusual. The rich information provided by paleoreconstructions should be incorporated in stochastic streamflow models, enabling the generation of realistic flow scenarios required for robust water resources planning and management. However, the magnitudes of reconstructed streamflow have a high degree of uncertainty. This apparent weakness of the paleodata has made their use in water resources planning contentious, despite their availability for many decades. However, few contest the accuracy of hydrologic state (i.e., dry and wet periods). A key question is how to combine the long paleoreconstructed streamflow information of lower reliability with the shorter observational data to develop a framework for streamflow simulation. We propose a unique stochastic streamflow simulation framework combining these two data sets. This has two components: (1) a nonhomogeneous Markov chain model, developed using the paleodata, which is used to simulate the hydrologic state, and (2) a nonparametric K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) time series bootstrap of observational flow magnitudes conditioned on the hydrologic state, thus combining the respective strengths of the two data sets. The framework is demonstrated for the Lees Ferry, Arizona, stream gauge on the Colorado River. The simulations show the ability to reproduce relevant statistics of the observational period and generate a rich variety of wet and dry sequences for use in sustainable management of water resources.},

title = {Simulating Ensembles of Source Water Quality Using a K-Nearest Neighbor Resampling Approach},
abstract = {Climatological, geological, and water management factors can cause significant variability in surface water quality. As drinking water quality standards become more stringent, the ability to quantify the variability of source water quality becomes more important for decision-making and planning in water treatment for regulatory compliance. However, paucity of long- term water quality data makes it challenging to apply traditional simulation techniques. To overcome this limitation, we have developed and applied a robust nonparametric K-nearest neighbor (K-nn) bootstrap approach utilizing the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Information Collection Rule (ICR) data. In this technique, first an appropriate ``feature vector'' is formed from the best available explanatory variables. The nearest neighbors to the feature vector are identified from the ICR data and are resampled using a weight function. Repetition of this results in water quality ensembles, and consequently the distribution and the quantification of the variability. The main strengths of the approach are its flexibility, simplicity, and the ability to use a large amount of spatialdata with limited temporal extent to provide water quality ensembles for any given location. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to simulate monthly ensembles of total organic carbon for two utilities in the U.S. with very different watersheds and to alkalinity and bromide at two other U.S. utilities.},

title = {A stochastic nonparametric technique for space-time disaggregation of streamflows},
abstract = {Stochastic disaggregation models are used to simulate streamflows at multiple sites preserving their temporal and spatial dependencies. Traditional approaches to this problem involve transforming the streamflow data of each month and at every location to a Gaussian structure and subsequently fitting a linear model in the transformed space. The simulations are then back transformed to the original space. The main drawbacks of this approach are (1) transforming marginals to Gaussian need not lead to the correct multivariate distribution particularly if the dependence across variables is nonlinear, and (2) the number of parameters to be estimated for a traditional disaggregation model grows rapidly with an increase in space or time components. We present a K-nearest-neighbor approach to resample monthly flows conditioned on an annual value in a temporal disaggregation or multiple upstream locations conditioned on a downstream location for a spatial disaggregation. The method is parsimonious, as the only parameter to estimate is K (the number of nearest neighbors to be used in resampling). Simulating space-time flow scenarios conditioned upon large-scale climate information (e.g., El Nin ̃o--Southern Oscillation, etc.) can be easily achieved. We demonstrate the utility of this methodology by applying it for space-time disaggregation of streamflows in the Upper Colorado River basin. The method appropriately captures the distributional and spatial dependency properties at all the locations.},

The approach described has been developed to facilitate integrated assessment research in support of regional resource management. Global climate model scenarios are evaluated and selected based on historic 20th century simulations. A statistical downscaling method is then applied to produce a regional data set. To facilitate the use of climate projections in hydrologic assessment, additional statistical mapping may be applied to generate synthetic station time series. Finally, results are presented from a regional climate model that indicate important differences in the regional climate response from what is captured by global models and statistical downscaling.},

title = {A nonparametric approach for representing interannualdependence in monthly streamflow sequences},
abstract = {The estimation of risks associated with water management plans requires generation of synthetic streamflow sequences. The mathematical algorithms used to generate these sequences at monthly timescales are found lacking in two main respects: inability in preserving dependence attributes particularly at large (seasonal to interannual) time lags and a poor representation of observed distributional characteristics, in particular, representation of strong asymmetry or multimodality in the probability density function. Proposed here is an alternative that naturally incorporates both observed dependence and distributional attributes in the generated sequences. Use of a nonparametric framework provides an effective means for representing the observed probability distribution, while the use of a ``variable kernel'' ensures accurate modeling of streamflow data sets that contain a substantial number of zero-flow values. A careful selection of prior flows imparts the appropriate short-term memory, while use of an ``aggregate'' flow variable allows representation of interannual dependence. The nonparametric simulation model is applied to monthly flows from the Beaver River near Beaver, Utah, and the Burrendong dam inflows, New South Wales, Australia.},

title = {Modified K-NN model for stochastic streamflow simulation},
abstract = {This paper presents a lag-1 modified K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) approach for stochastic streamflow simulation. The simula- tion at any time t given the value at the time t−1 involves two steps: (1) obtaining the conditional mean from a local polynomial fitted to the historical values of time t and t−1, and (2) then resampling (i.e., bootstrapping) a residual at one of the historical observations and adding it to the conditional mean. The residuals are resampled using a probability metric that gives more weight to the nearest neighbor and less to the farthest. The ``residual resampling'' step is the modification to the traditional K-NN time-series bootstrap approach, which enables the generation of values not seen in the historical record. This model is applied to monthly streamflow at the Lees Ferry stream gauge on the Colorado River and is compared to both a parametric periodic autoregressive and a nonparametric index sequential method for streamflow generation, each widely used in practice. The modified K-NN approach is found to exhibit better performance in terms of capturing the features present in the data.},

A parametric quantile regression approach and a semiparametric local likelihood approach are compared using synthetic data sets and for data from a streamflow gauging station in the western United States.

title = {Conditional resampling of hydrologic time series using multiple predictor variables: A K-nearest neighbour approach},
abstract = {Unlike parametric alternatives for time series generation, non-parametric approaches generate new values by conditionally resampling past observations using a probability rationale. Observations lying "close" to the conditioning vector are resampled with higher probability, "closeness" is defined using a Euclidean or Mahalanobis distance formulation. A common problem with these approaches is the difficulty in distinguishing the importance of each predictor in the estimation of the distance. As a consequence, the conditional probability and hence the resampled series, can offer a biased representation of the true population it aims to sim- ulate. This paper presents a variation of the K-nearest neighbour resampler designed for use with multiple predictor variables. In the modification proposed, an influence weight is assigned to each predictor in the conditioning set with the aim of identifying nearest neighbours that represent the conditional dependence in an improved manner. The workability of the proposed modification is tested using synthetic data from known linear and non-linear models and its applicability is illustrated through an example where daily rainfall is downscaled over 15 stations near Sydney, Australia using a predictor set consisting of selected large-scale atmo- spheric circulation variables.},

title = {Statistical downscaling using K-nearest neighbors},
abstract = {Statistical downscaling provides a technique to derive local scale information of precipitation and temperature from numerical weather prediction model output. The K- nearest neighbor (K-nn) is a new analog-type approach that is used in this paper to downscale the NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) 1998 medium range forecast (MRF) model output. The K-nn algorithm queries days similar to a given feature vector in this archive, and using EOF (Empirical Orthogonal Functions) analysis identifies a subset of days (K) similar to the feature day. These K days are then weighted using a bi-square weight function, and randomly sampled to generate ensembles. A set of 15 MRF runs was used, and 7 ensemble members were generated from each run. The ensemble of 105 members was then used to select the local scale precipitation and temperature values in four diverse basins across the contiguous US. These downscaled precipitation and temperature estimates were subsequently analyzed to test the performance of this downscaling approach.The downscaled ensembles were evaluated in terms of bias, the ranked probability skill score as a measure of forecast skill, spatial co-variability between stations, temporal persistence, the consistency between variables, conditional bias, and to develop spread- skill relationships. Though this approach does not explicitly model the space-time variability of the weather fields at each individual stations, the above statistics were extremely well captured. The K-nn method was also compared with a multiple linear regression based downscaling model.},

title = {Interferential Impact of ENSO and PDO on Dry and Wet Conditions in the U. S. Great Plains},
abstract = {The influence of the El Nin ̃o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) interference on the dry and wet conditions in the Great Plains of the United States (US) has been examined using monthly observational datasets. It is shown that both ENSO and PDO can generate a similar pattern of atmospheric and oceanic anomalies over the eastern part of the North Pacific and western North America that has significant impact on the climate over the Great Plains. Furthermore, the relationship between ENSO/PDO and climate anomalies in the Great Plains is intensified when ENSO and PDO are in phase (El Nin ̃o and warm PDO, or La Nin ̃a and cold PDO). On average, anomalies over the Great Plains favor wet (dry) conditions when both ENSO and PDO are in the positive (negative) phase. However, when ENSO and PDO are out of phase, the relationship is weakened and the anomalies over the Great Plains tend toward neutral. Without ENSO, PDO alone does not affect the North American climate significantly. The relationship is quite robust for different seasons with strongest effects for the months of spring, weakest effects for the months of autumn, while the months of winter and summer fall in-between. The seasonality of the relationship may be associated with the seasonal dependence of the anomalies of general circulation and the pattern of mean seasonal cycle in the North Pacific.The contrasting impact of the interference of ENSO and PDO on the climate anomalies in the Great Plains is associated with differences in the ocean-atmosphere anomalies. When ENSO and PDO are in phase, the sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies extend from the equatorial Pacific to the higher latitudes of the North Pacific via the eastern ocean. The distribution of the corresponding anomalies of sea level pressure (SLP) and the wind at 1000 hPa forms an ellipse with a southeast-northwest orientation of the long axis because the SST anomalies promote coherent changes in SLP in the central North Pacific. In the upper troposphere, a similar teleconnection pattern with the same sign generated by ENSO and PDO is overlapped and enhanced, which favors anomaly (dry and wet) condition in the Great Plains. However, when ENSO and PDO are out of phase, the SST anomalies have the same sign in the tropical and central North Pacific, which is opposite to the anomalies near the west coast of North America. The anomalously cyclonic circulation over the North Pacific is weaker in the out-of-phase situation than in the in-phase situation. The distribution of the anomalies of SLP and the wind at 1000 hPa resembles a circle. Meanwhile, in the upper troposphere, ENSO and PDO generate a similar teleconnection pattern with opposite sign, causing cancellation of the anomalous circulation and favoring neutral climate in the Great Plains.},
