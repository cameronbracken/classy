1. A strange attractor is a region of state space to which all solutions converge. A system of nonlinear differential equations of dimension >3 is required to produce a strange attractor. 

2. 
	a) Both trajectories rotate about the strange attractor but in vastly different ways, jumping between the 'wings' of the butterfly erratically. 
	
	b) The number of times a solution rotates in an attractor basin is not predictable, sometimes the solution stays in a basin for many rotations, sometimes only one. 
	
	c)  It indicates that if the weather system is indeed chaotic then
