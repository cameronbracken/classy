The first article about the Runge-Kutta method describes several implementations and their advantages and disadvantages. The Euler method is the most efficient but least accurate of the methods and is rarely used in practice.   Similarly the second order Runge-Kutta is more accurate and less efficient and is also rarely used in practice.  Higher order Runge-Kutta methods use in-between steps to help make evaluation of the derivate at the  end of the interval more accurate. The fourth order Runge-Kutta method is often used in practice because of its reasonable balance between efficiency and accuracy.
