# History (The Book)

## Overview
- First GCM developed in mid-1950s
	- 5k of memory!
- First Modern GCM in 1960s along with first RC (Radio Convective) models
- First EBM described in 1969
- First SD (Statistical Dynamical) model in 1970
	- Evolved into EMIC (Earth Models of Intermediate Complexity)
- First GCMs evolved from smaller scale weather models used for forecasting
	
## Notables
- Syukuro Manabe 
	- Worked for NOAAs Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory
	- Spearheaded design of RC models, 1961
- Juli\`an Adem
	- 1965, Low resolution thermodynamic model 
		- Simpler than GCM and similar to EBM
- Mikhail Budyko and William Sellers
	- 1969, Described first EBM
	- Not dependent on complex weather prediction schemes
	- Suggested that climatic zones were roughly latitudinal
	- Motivated study of climate on geologic time scale 
- John Green 
	- Spearheaded SD models in early 1970s
	- Paved the way for 2D models
- The GCM
	- Took off by 1980
		- Highly nonlinear and highly complex
	- Mid to late 1980s
		- Correct results generated for wrong reasons
		- Push toward Hierarchy of climate modeling tools
			
## Ocean GCMs
- Kirk Bryan
	- Developed model which is basis for modern ocean GCMs
	- Modern version is Bryan-Cox-Semtner model
	- Current resolution is 1/6 degree or 2 degrees with coupled atmo GCM
- First GCMs used treated oceans as infinite source of moisture
	- Based on monthly observations
	- difficult to disturb climate system
- late 1980s, mixed upper layer approach
	- Only good for less than 30 years
	
## Todays challenges
- Non-equilibrium conditions
	- Transient forcing (solar variability, CO2, land surface change)
- Interdisciplinary efforts
	- Specialization (land-surface climatology)
	
## Sensitivity of Climate Models
- Refers to models reaction when "poked"
- Albedo example
	- Earth changes from Ice-Covered -> Partially Covered -> No Ice depending on Critical temperature
	- Critical temperature ranges from 263K to 283K
	- Not a single equilibrium, all three equilibrium states are possible
- Sensitivity analysis is important for 'external' and 'internal stability'
	- 'External Stability', 2 solutions, bifurcation
		- _Unstable_: If Solar constant is reduced below mucS, the albedo is nearly 1, the global energy balance cannot be maintained, and an equilibrium solution is not possible. 
		- _Stable_: Model functions as normal
	- 'Internal Stability'	
		- If we started a transient model with a solution near an equilibrium soution, would the model tent toward that solution
		- _Transitive_: Different IC lead to same ending (normal) state
		- _Intransitive_: Different IC leads to different ending state
		- _Almost Intransitive_: Model acts transitively but eventually flips to alternate state. Extremely difficult to successfully. 
- Sensitivity can take many forms, the quantifying of which can measure many things 
	- Agreement with observations may even be misleading
		- Narrow record
