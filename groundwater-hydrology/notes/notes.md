# Groundwater Flow Theory

## Porosity, Hydrogeologic units - 24 August 2010 [lecture1]
> _Groundwater Hydrology_: The study of the occurrence, movement and distribution of groundwater and the movement of chemicals in the water

#### Objectives 
- Calculate the porosity of a porous medium 
- Describe the effects on porosity of 
	- grain shape, grain size, pocketing, sorting
- Define the three main hydrologic units 
    - aquifer, aquitard, water table, confined aquifer, unconfined aquifer, capilary fringe, vadose zone

#### Porosity 

<< n = V_v/V_T >>

<< V_v >> = Volume of voids

<< V_T >> = Total volume

##### Porosity doesn't depend on

- Size of grains

##### Porosity depends on

- Shape of the grains 
- packing

#### Packing

- Cubic n=0.48

Aquifer
: Material that transmits water

Aquitard 
: Very impermeable region 

Capillary Fringe
: saturated zone where saturation is due to capillary rise where pressure is negative

Vadose 
: unsaturated zone above an unconfined aquifer

Unconfined aquifer
: free surface, friadic aquifer
