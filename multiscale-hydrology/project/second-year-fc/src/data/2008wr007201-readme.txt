Introduction 

This data set contains the tree-ring chronology data from 51 sites used in the nonparametric reconstruction
of streamflow at the Lees Ferry, Arizona gauge. The analysis was carried out using three end years in the
overlap period, 1997 (overlap period, 1906-1997; 92 years), 2002 (overlap period, 1906-2002; 97 years), and
2005 (overlap period, 1906-2005; 100 years). The naturalized flow time series for water years 1906-2005 
used in this study is also provided. All time series data are provided as a single tab-delimited data set.
Missing chronology values are represented with NA.
